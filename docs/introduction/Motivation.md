# Motivation

Redux has made data store mutations predictable, but it has also made them verbose. This tool was made with that in mind. Abundance of boilerplate can be painful to write and read. Keeping track of action string constants in your action creators and reducers can be overwhelming for beginners. `redux-actions` is the utility belt for [FSA](https://github.com/redux-utilities/flux-standard-action)-compliant actions in Redux. With helpers for both handling and creating actions it makes working with an FSA in Redux easier for everyone.
